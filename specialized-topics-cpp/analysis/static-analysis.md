
### C++

Recommend static analysis tools for a C++ project. The tool should be capable of identifying security vulnerabilities.

I need a quick review of Cppcheck with key features and limitations. Also include a sample Cppcheck command to scan a C++ project.

How do I implement Cppcheck for a C++ project built using VS Code?

How do I integrate Cppcheck into my CI/CD pipeline for automated security checks with GitHub Actions?
