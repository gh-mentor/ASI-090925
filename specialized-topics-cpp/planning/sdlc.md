## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

```
I am an experienced software engineer and would like an overview how GitHub Copilot can be integrated into the software development life cycle. 
- Provide a detailed explanation of how Copilot can assist in each phase of the SDLC, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Include specific examples of tasks or activities within each phase where Copilot can be particularly beneficial.

## Designing a Web-Based Invoicing Application with GNU C++ (REST API) and ReactJS

```
My team consists of experienced GNU C++ developers. I need step-by-step guidance to design a web-based invoicing application with the following requirements:

1. Build a RESTful API for managing invoices and clients.
2. Use MongoDB (NoSQL) for data storage.
3. Implement invoice management logic for adding/removing invoice items and clients.
4. Generate billing and ageing reports.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for invoice management.
6. Set up secure authentication and authorization.
7. Implement robust error handling and logging.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend tools, frameworks, and libraries for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies for each step.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.
- Add diagrams or architecture visuals if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.
- Don't include any sample code.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Enable my team to confidently execute each phase of the invoicing application project with a clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.
````

## Test Plan for Invoicing Application
```
I also need help creating a test plan for the invoicing application that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. My team has experience with GNU C++ and ReactJS. The application is built using C++ (REST API backend) and ReactJS (frontend). The test plan should include:
- Test objectives
- Test strategy
- Test environment
- Test schedule
- Test resources
- Test deliverables

```

## System Planning,  Design, and Implementation for Azure Infrastructure

```
I am a lead systems engineer. I need step-by-step guidance to plan, design, and implement these Azure tasks:

1. Create a cloud environment.
2. Set up a web server.
3. Add a load balancer.
4. Set up a database server.
5. Configure networking (VPC, subnets, security groups).
6. Implement infrastructure security.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend Azure tools/services for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, reliability, and security.
- Add diagrams if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations brief and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Help my team confidently execute each task with clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.

## Launch a Web-Based Platform Using GNU C++ (REST API) and ReactJS on Azure

```
I am leading a team to launch a web-based platform using GNU C++ (REST API backend) and ReactJS (frontend) on Azure. Please provide:

1. A step-by-step plan for setting up the Azure infrastructure (App Service, MongoDB or Cosmos DB, networking, security).
2. Recommended Azure services and tools for each step, with brief explanations.
3. Best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.
4. An architecture diagram or workflow visual.
5. Common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
6. A summary checklist for the deployment process.

**Goal:**  
Guide the team to plan, design, and implement a scalable, secure, and maintainable invoicing application using Azure, GNU C++, and ReactJS.
